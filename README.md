# Bookly_desktopApp
This is a desktop application called Bookly, it was developed in C# and is very simple.
In this repository you can see the code for the home screen, user login and registration pages, and administrator login pages.

I am currently developing a website in PHP related to this application.

There are some parts of this application, such as the login and registration pages, that use a database developed for the platform. This database is also being used on the PHP website.

The database is not in this repository.
