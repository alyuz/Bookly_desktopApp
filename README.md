# Bookly_desktopApp
This is a desktop application called Bookly, it was developed in C# and is very simple. 

I'm currently developing a website in PHP that is related to this application. 

There are some parts of this application, such as the sign in and sign up pages, that use a database developed for the platform. This databese is also being used on the PHP website. 

The database are not in this repository.
